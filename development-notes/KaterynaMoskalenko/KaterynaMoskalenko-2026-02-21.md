- A personal challenge in this task is the integration of artificial intelligence in the application. I've never encountered this before. I'm reviewing various videos, including the RSSchool , and reading information on how it works.

- It was agreed that at the next meeting, tentatively scheduled for February 23, the Eslint configuration files will be discussed, and the Teamlead has a rough outline of the application architecture. The components will be distributed among the players.

- The Teamlead developed general rules and instructions and created a development branch for the main development, also configuration files for installation - familiarization with these rules and familiarization with the main instructions.
